Description: A weighting approach the employs kernels to make one group
    have a similar distribution to another group on covariates
    not only in terms of means or marginal distributions, but also on higher order transformations implied
    by the choice of kernel. This applies to both treatment
    effect estimation and to survey reweighting problems.
    Based on  Hazlett, C. (2020) "Kernel Balancing: A flexible
    non-parametric weighting procedure
    for estimating causal effects." Statistica Sinica.
