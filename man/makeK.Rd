\title{Build the Gaussian Kernel Matrix}
\usage{
makeK(allx, useasbases = NULL, b = NULL, linkernel = FALSE, scale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{allx}{A data matrix containing all observations where rows are units and columns are covariates.}

\item{useasbases}{Vector argument containing one's and zero's with length equal to the number of observations (rows in \code{allx}) to specify which bases to use when constructing the kernel matrix (columns of \eqn{K}). If not specified, the default is to use all observations.}

\item{b}{Scaling factor in the calculation of Gaussian kernel distance equivalent to the entire denominator \eqn{2\sigma^2} of the exponent. Default is twice the number of covariates or columns in \code{allx}.}

\item{linkernel}{Indicates that user wants linear kernel, \eqn{K=XX'}, which in practice employs \eqn{K=X}.}

\item{scale}{boolean flag for whether or not to standardize \code{allx} (demeaned with sd=1) before constructing the kernel matrix}
}
\value{
\item{K}{The kernel matrix}
}
\description{
Builds the Gaussian kernel matrix using Rcpp.

\examples{
#load and clean data a bit
\donttest{
data(lalonde)
xvars=c("age","black","educ","hisp","married","re74","re75","nodegr","u74","u75")

#note that lalonde$nsw is the treatment vector, so the observed is 1-lalonde$nsw
#running makeK with the sampled/control units as the bases given 
#the large size of the data
K = makeK(allx = lalonde[,xvars], useasbases = 1-lalonde$nsw)
