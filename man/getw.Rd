\title{Find Weights using Entropy Balancing.}
\usage{
getw(target, observed, svd.U, ebal.tol = 1e-06, ebal.maxit = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{target}{a numeric vector of length equal to the total number of units where population/treated units take a value of 1 and sample/control units take a value of 0.}

\item{observed}{a numeric vector of length equal to the total number of units where sampled/control units take a value of 1 and population/treated units take a value of 0.}

\item{svd.U}{a matrix of left singular vectors from performing \code{svd()} on the kernel matrix.}

\item{ebal.tol}{tolerance level used by custom entropy balancing function \code{ebalance_custom}}

\item{ebal.maxit}{maximum number of iterations in optimization search used by \code{ebalance_custom}}
}
\value{
\item{w}{numeric vector of weights.}
\item{converged}{boolean indicating if \code{ebalance_custom} converged}
\item{ebal_error}{returns error message if \code{ebalance_custom} encounters an error}
}
\description{
Uses entropy balancing to find and return the weights that produce mean balance on \eqn{\phi(X_i)}, the expanded features of \eqn{X_i} using a given kernel \eqn{\phi(.)}, for the control or sample group and treated group or target population.

\examples{
\donttest{
#load and clean data a bit
data(lalonde)
xvars=c("age","black","educ","hisp","married","re74","re75","nodegr","u74","u75")

#need a kernel matrix to run SVD on then find weights with so get that first with makeK
#running makeK with the sampled units as the bases
K = makeK(allx = lalonde[,xvars], useasbases = 1-lalonde$nsw)

#svd on this kernel and get matrix with left singular values
U = svd(K)$u
#usually search over all columns of U to find which produces weights with 
#the minimum bias bound; in this ex, search only first 10 dims
U2=U[,1:10]
